# SimLand <small>â€” A web browser game inspired by a classic</small>

This game runs entirely from your browser.

## Building

Any public service has a maintenance cost, for you to pay.
A house, a industry, or any other private initiative will be built
only if there are demand and manpower.

## Pollution may kill you

Pay attention! Pollution will appear fast with your city growing.
Trees can save the population and your job.

## Cheating

You can change some game attributes by accessing the <code>land</code>
object at the javascript console. Try to open the javascript console
pressing F12 key or some browser menu item, then run:
    land.money = 1000000
(the status information will not be updated until the next month)

## Time to fall

Some day some building will be destructed. You have been warned.
